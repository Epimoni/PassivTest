        <P>
          Passiv is a web app that helps you manage your portfolio and maintain
          a desired target allocation. It calculates the trades needed based on
          the target allocation you’ve set and your available cash.{' '}

        <H3>Who is Passiv for?</H3>
        <P>
          Passiv is for individuals who prefer to manage their own retirement
          portfolio and are tired of losing money to high management fees. It’s
          for anyone who wants to automate the tedious parts of portfolio
          management, like allocating new cash and rebalancing.

        <H3>Does Passiv store my brokerage login credentials?</H3>
        <P>
          No, Passiv does not ask for or store users’ login credentials. To link
          your account to Passiv, Passiv sends you over to your broker's website
          with a secure request for account access. When you approve Passiv's
          access request, Passiv receives an access token to read your account
          information. To read more about this process, click{' '}

        <H3>Will using Passiv void my broker's terms of service?</H3>
        <P>
          Using Passiv will not void your terms of service. Passiv works with
          brokers as an official API partner, which means we are compliant with
          their rules for third party account access.

        <H3>What is an API?</H3>
        <P>
          An API is a set of definitions, protocols and tools for building
          software. In short, an API makes it possible for Passiv to connect
          with your brokerage.

        <H3>Why do you need trade access?</H3>
        <P>
          Trade access is needed if you’d like to use the One-Click Trades
          feature, where Passiv executes trades on your behalf with the click of
          one button. If you do not want to use this feature, you can disable
          trade access from your Settings page under Connections.

        <H3>
          Is it possible to use the other Elite features without giving Passiv
          trade access?
        </H3>
        <P>
          Yes, simply go to the Settings page and reconnect Passiv with
          read-only access. This removes trading access.

      </ShadowBox>
      <ShadowBox>
        <H3>Is Passiv a robo-advisor?</H3>
        <P>
          No, Passiv is a software tool that helps DIY investors determine what
          trades are needed to allocate new cash and rebalance their portfolios.
          If you’ve given Passiv trading access, it can also execute the trades
          on your behalf with just one click.

      </ShadowBox>
      <ShadowBox>
        <H3>Will Passiv recommend a portfolio for me to follow?</H3>
        <P>
          No, you must know which equities you’d like to hold and your target
          allocation for each. Passiv is not qualified to give investment
          advice.
